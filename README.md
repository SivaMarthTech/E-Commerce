# Nostra E-commerce Clothing Brand

## Description

Nostra is a modern, fully responsive e-commerce clothing brand website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website offers a rich user experience with multiple sections, including product showcases, a newsletter, and a contact form. It is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring smooth browsing across all devices.

## Features

- **Offer Banner**: A banner that appears on the homepage with a close button that closes the banner temporarily (it reappears on page reload).
- **Movable Header Images**: Images in the header section are horizontally scrollable, providing a dynamic visual.
- **Shop Now Button**: The button changes color on mouse hover and redirects users to the `collection.html` page.
- **Brand Section**: Displayed in cards, where each card flips when hovered, showing more information about the brand.
- **New Arrivals**: A section with product cards that feature an animation or zoom effect on hover. Clicking on "Buy Now" redirects to the `new_arrivals.html` page.
- **Most Wanted**: A section displaying products in a card format. Hovering enlarges the card. The second division of the card displays product details, and a "Buy Now" button redirects to the `most_wanted.html` page.
- **Limited Offer Banner**: The banner changes the image to black and white when hovered and redirects users to the `collection.html` page upon clicking "Shop Now".
- **Join Our Newsletter**: A section with an input field and subscribe button to collect email addresses.
- **Footer Section**: Contains quick links to sections of the site such as New Arrivals, Most Wanted, and Collection.
